some open ended issues:

  need to update README greatly to reflect updates to convert.py and the risk modeling pipeline

  models:
    no idea where the models for phomopsis, powdery mildew, and black rot came from
    should reread broom 1995 paper to confirm wet event classification method
    should likely disengage risk measurement for dry events, but should confirm

  plotting:
    plotting all diseases on the same figure makes them difficult to read
    x-axis is in crazy units - should print some dates instead
